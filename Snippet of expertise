In this modern age, fears are rising over the potential for security breaches in the new crypto markets. Yet in my experience the common and much more prevalent threat remains comically old school. I've spent years dealing with the victims of check fraud. Most people would say, "wait people use checks still?" And the answer is, kind of. The usage of checks has greatly declined, yet the losses via check fraud recorded by financial institutions has steady rose. From plain old mail theft, to long term romance scams, I have witnessed people from all walks of life provide seriously critical personal and financial data without a second thought. My job was to monitor deposit and transaction activity to determine when and where fraudulent activity occurred. I spent countless hours discussing the source of very obviously fraudulent checks, and just about everyone refused to provide any real info on the person that bad put them in over $10k debt. In the cases in which information was provided it was a false name from a Facebook or Instagram chat. However checks did not consume my entire work life. In fact I spent quite a lot of time dealing with researching IP addresses to determine the source of a funds transfer or a cash app transaction. As stated before, for reasons dealing with shame or pure distain for the financial system the customer was rarely a source of truth. I spent my time collecting samples of activity with digital finger prints tied to physical locations in order to build a case against someone who would fight tooth and nail to tell you that their husband they never met yet, truly NEEDS their monthly Bitcoin payment. All in all it was a lesson in criminal psychology, as much as it was FinTech.
